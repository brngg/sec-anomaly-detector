# SEC Filing Anomaly Detector — Codebase Summary (Snapshot)

**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Purpose:** Automated detection of suspicious filing patterns in SEC EDGAR data (late filings, 8‑K bursts, suspicious timing).

---

## Project status (high level)
- Week‑1 completed: DB schema implemented, SQLite DB created, DB utilities added, FastAPI dependency wired, ingestion backfill implemented.
- Polling implemented: hybrid poller (current feed + catch-up) + GitHub Actions cron (every 15 minutes) that commits DB updates.
- Week‑2 in progress: detection MVP started (NT, Friday after-hours, 8-K monthly spike), shared alert helper added.
- Next priorities: validation workflow polish, basic API endpoints, and alerting UX.

## Database schema (implemented)
- **DB:** `data/sec_anomaly.db` (SQLite)

Tables:
- `companies`
  - `cik` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `name`, `ticker`, `industry`, `updated_at` (ISO timestamp default)
- `filing_events`
  - `accession_id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY, `cik` FK → `companies(cik)`, `filing_type` NOT NULL, `filed_at` NOT NULL (ISO timestamp), `filed_date` NOT NULL, `primary_document`
  - Indexes: `idx_filing_events_cik_type_filed_at`, `idx_filing_events_filed_at`
- `watermarks`
  - `cik` PRIMARY KEY, `last_seen_filed_at`, `updated_at`, `last_run_at`, `last_run_status`, `last_error`
- `poll_state`
  - `key` PRIMARY KEY, `value` — internal poller state (e.g., last catch-up timestamp)
- `alerts`
  - `alert_id` PK, `accession_id` FK → `filing_events(accession_id)`, `anomaly_type`, `severity_score`, `description`, `details` (JSON text), `status`, `dedupe_key` UNIQUE, `created_at`

Timestamps are stored as ISO‑8601 `TEXT` (SQLite `datetime('now')` default) for portability.

---

## DB helpers (`src/db/db_utils.py`)
- `get_conn()` — context manager that yields a `sqlite3.Connection`, sets `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`, commits on success and rollbacks on error.
- `upsert_company(conn, ...)`, `insert_filing(conn, ...)`, `update_watermark(conn, ...)` — central CRUD helpers to use from ingestion and API.
- `foreign_key_check(conn)` — helper to verify referential integrity.

**Usage pattern:** Always use `with get_conn() as conn:` in ingestion or API code to ensure FK enforcement and consistent transaction handling.

---

## Ingestion / Backfill (current)
- `src/ingestion/backfill.py` implements:
  1. CSV‑driven ticker list (`data/companies.csv` by default)
  2. `SEC_IDENTITY` env‑var configuration (fallback with warning)
  3. Fetch filings for past 6 months via `edgartools`
  4. Insert filings (deduped on `accession_id`)
  5. Update `watermarks` per company
- Supports throttling, retries/backoff, and `DRY_RUN=1`.

## Polling (current)
- `src/ingestion/poll.py` implements a hybrid poller:
  1. Loads tracked CIKs from `companies` + watermarks
  2. Scans **all pages** of the current filings feed, filters to target forms and tracked CIKs
  3. Inserts new filings (deduped by `accession_id`)
  4. Updates `watermarks` per company based on the latest seen filing
  5. Optional catch-up: for **stale/missing** watermarks, queries per-company filings since last seen
  6. Catch-up cooldown stored in `poll_state` to prevent running every poll
  7. Emits timing logs for feed scan, per-company catch-up, and total runtime
- GitHub Actions runs every 15 minutes and commits DB updates to the repo.

## Detection (current)
- `src/detection/nt_detection.py`
  - Flags `NT %` and `NT-%` filings as anomalies
  - Scores by form type (fixed mapping) and writes to `alerts`
- `src/detection/friday_detection.py`
  - Flags Friday after-hours filings (US/Eastern, >= 4pm)
  - MVP scope: `8-K` and `8-K/A`
- `src/detection/8k_spike_detection.py`
  - Flags monthly 8-K spikes vs company baseline (zero-months included)
  - Threshold = mean + 2σ (company-specific)
- `src/detection/alerts.py`
  - Shared `insert_alert(...)` helper for detectors

---

## Verification checklist (before backfill)
- `ls -l data/sec_anomaly.db` — DB file exists
- `sqlite3 data/sec_anomaly.db ".tables"` — tables present
- `python3 -c "from src.db.db_utils import get_conn; with get_conn() as c: print(c.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys;').fetchone()[0])"` → should print `1`
- `sqlite3 data/sec_anomaly.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"` → `ok`
- `sqlite3 data/sec_anomaly.db "PRAGMA foreign_key_check;"` → empty (no violations)
- Smoke test: upsert a company then insert a filing via `get_conn()` helpers and confirm rows.

---

## Next implementation priorities
1. Add a detection runner (single command for all detectors).
2. Add basic API endpoints (`/health`, `/companies`, `/companies/{cik}/filings`, `/filings/{accession}`).
3. Add tests and prepare a Postgres migration plan.

---

## Fixes & Improvements (recent)
- **Hybrid poller:** replaced single-page current feed with full feed scan plus catch-up for stale companies.
- **Cooldown:** added `poll_state` table and `POLL_CATCHUP_COOLDOWN_HOURS` to throttle catch-up.
- **Early exit:** feed scan can stop early using a safety buffer (`POLL_FEED_BUFFER_HOURS`).
- **Timings:** added feed and catch-up duration logging to surface runtime hotspots.
